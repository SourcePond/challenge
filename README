Prerequisites: Installed JDK11

This is my solution for the programming challenge. To run this, you can simply build the project:
- On a console, navigate to this project folder and type "./gradlew build" ("gradlew.bat build" on Windows).
- Press enter and wait until the build is done.
- You'll find a TAR and ZIP file in ./build/distributions/
- Choose either one, extract it and run challenge/bin/challenge (or challenge.bat on Windows)

Main-class is org.sourcepond.challenge.app.Application
